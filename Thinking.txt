Okay, so I need to figure out how I want the update to work.
There's two types of training.
One is in the "real" game.
The other is in the fake games against random AIs.

So what it should keep track of is the sequence of scenarios, the move it made, and the score at the end.
And also know what mode it's in (for the correct factor to be used).

Then, you also need to do explore exploit as well, but only in the "real" game.

So what it should do is train by testing each move and playing randomly afterwards and updating accordingly.
Then, after all those updates have happened, explore/exploit, and keep track of all those moves.
Then, update the real game.

I still need to do the win function, assign scores when there's an end, actually update based on those scores, and code stuff for a random AI and human to play.
