'''
This is a reinforcement learning AI that learns to play the game of TicTacToe by
...playing against random opponents - and you!

I've coded so that it doesn't require understanding any advanced coding techniques.
(I don't use classes, list comprehensions, slicing, etc.)
(Understanding the code fully generally requires understanding variables,
...functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, and basic format strings.)

In this code, a TicTacToe game is represented by a list of 9 values.
For example, the board

OXO
-OX
XOX

is represented in the code with
["opp", "ai", "opp", "empty", "opp", "ai", "ai", "opp", "ai"]

I go from right-to-left, top-to-bottom (just like reading).
("opp" is short for "opponent")

Then, the AI stores a dictionary (database) of all the game boards its ever seen.
Each game board has its own dictionary (database) of moves that the AI has made in that scenario.
Then, each move is given a score of how good it is for the AI.

All moves start out with a DEFAULT_SCORE of 0.
If a move is definitely a win, the score should be closer to a WIN_SCORE of 5.
If it's definitely a loss, it should be closer to a LOSE_SCORE of -100.
If the move definitely leads to a tie, it should be closer to a TIE_SCORE of 1.
(Feel free to play around with these numbers!)

When the AI needs to make a move, it tries all of the moves!
It plays 3 (FAKE_GAME_AMOUNT) completely random games for each of the moves it tries.
Then, it updates the move scores based on how those games turned out.
(This practice is called Monte Carlo estimation: you try stuff randomly and see how it turns out.)

Move scores are updated using the following rule:
NEW_MOVE_SCORE = OLD_MOVE_SCORE + (GAME_SCORE - OLD_MOVE_SCORE) * UPDATE_AMOUNT
UPDATE_AMOUNT = GAME_FACTOR * DISCOUNT_FACTOR
DISCOUNT_FACTOR = (DISTANCE_DISCOUNT ** (DISTANCE_FROM_END))

GAME_SCORE
The outcome of the game: either WIN_SCORE, TIE_SCORE, or LOSE_SCORE.

UPDATE_AMOUNT
A number between 0 and 1.
How much we want to update the score to match the new score we saw.
For example if UPDATE_AMOUNT is 0.5, then we'll change the NEW_MOVE_SCORE to be halfway between the OLD_MOVE_SCORE and the GAME_SCORE.

GAME_FACTOR
Usually around 0.5
Set based on who the AI is playing.
It will be higher when playing against humans so that it updates scores more from those games.

DISTANCE_DISCOUNT
Between 0 and 1
Makes it so that moves early on in the game aren't updated as much
...because we're not actually certain that early moves cause the late-game outcomes.
(It could be that bad moves were made late in the game.)
For example, if your first move is in the center, but you lose the game,
...that doesn't mean that the first move was actually bad.
The bigger this is, the more early moves are affected by later losses.

DISTANCE_FROM_END
A whole number between 1 and 5.
How many moves away the move is from the last move of the game.
It will be higher when moves are early on in the game, and 1 if it's the last move of the game.
(This only counts moves from the perspective of the AI; the fastest possible game is 3 moves, the longest is 5.)


This equation for updating the scores is known as a Bellman Update equation,
...and is the main equation used in reinforcement learning!
Hopefully it's explained in a way here that doesn't make it too scary!

Basically, you take the old score and try to move it closer to the score you got for the game.
But since you want to learn less from playing bad opponents, and you also aren't certain that you couldn't have played better,
...you don't want to set the score for the move to just be the outcome of the game.
So, you shrink how much you change the score based on who you're playing
...and how many moves the move was from the end of the game.
Moves closer to the end of the game were probably more responsible for losing the game, so they get updated more.
Learning from better opponents is probably better, so you update moves more when playing against good opponents.

Then, after playing these random games and updating the scores, it picks a move.
It has a small chance to pick a non-optimal move so that it learns more about other scenarios.
If it picks an optimal move, we say it's "exploiting", and if it picks a non-optimal move, we say it's "exploring".

Finally, when the game is over, it saves what it learned so it can use that info for the next game!

With that said, here's the code! Enjoy! :)
